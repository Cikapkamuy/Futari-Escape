  "description": "Two young women–one an overworked manga artist, the other a complete slacker–try to escape the realities of adult responsibilities. Whether it’s running off on a day trip instead of being productive or going into debt for an epic meal, the two always have fun when they’re together! Enjoy this delightful (and relatable) slice-of-life tale about the little pleasures in ducking away from the hard stuff.\n",
